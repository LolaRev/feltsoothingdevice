# feltsoothingdevice

Project Description: The Felt-Soothing Device allows a parent to communicate with their child in the other room - as a way to trigger a soothing song that would help the child resume sleep if they are crying. We envision it coming with different felt options for casings so that each user can customize their paired devices in whichever way they want.

2 Arduino devices - one with speaker and one with button.
